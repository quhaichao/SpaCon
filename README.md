# SpaCon

Understanding brain organization requires integrating spatial transcriptomics and connectomics, yet specialized methods are lacking. Here, we elucidated gene expression patterns in anatomically connected regions at the cellular level and introduced SpaCon, a deep-learning approach that integrates connectivity with spatial transcriptomic data to identify spatial domains where gene expression aligns with connectivity. Validated across multiple datasets, SpaCon robustly bridges the gap between connectome and transcriptome, offering critical insights into brain architecture.
